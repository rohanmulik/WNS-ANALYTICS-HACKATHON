# WNS-ANALYTICS-HACKATHON

Problem Statement:-

In this competition our client is WNS Analytics, a large MNC company. They want us to identify the right person for a promotion. Currently, this process consists of several steps:

1]They first identify a set of employees based on recommendations and past performance;
2]Selected employees go through the separate training and evaluation program for each vertical. These programs are based on the required skill of each vertical;
3]At the end of the program, based on various factors such as training performance, KPI completion (only employees with KPIs completed greater than 60% are considered) etc., an employee gets a promotion.


As you might guess, the whole process takes a lot of time. One way to speed it up, so a company would save time and money, is to determine the right candidate at the checkpoint. We will use a data-driven approach to predict if the candidate would be promoted or not. Our prediction will be based on employee’s performance from nomination for promotion to the checkpoint and number of demographic features.

The problem of competition is formulated as a binary classification task, evaluation metrics is F1 score. The training set consists of 54808 examples, test set — 23490 examples. Only 8.5% of employees are recommended for promotion.
